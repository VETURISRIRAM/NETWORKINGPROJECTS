# Network Traffic using Wireshark

Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer.
Wireshark consists of two parts: one is a packet capture engine powered by
[tcpdump](http://www.tcpdump.org/), and the other is a powerful and expressive
packet parsing capability that understands hundreds of different network
protocols.

`CapturedTraffic.pcap` is a pcap file which includes an application programming interface for capturing network traffic of the files in `pacaps`. You can view the captured traffic using Wireshark.
